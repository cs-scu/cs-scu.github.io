# Website for the Computer Science Association of SCU

This repository contains the source code for the official website of the Computer Science Scientific Association at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz. The project is a modern, client-side rendered Single-Page Application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Supabase as its backend.

## âœ¨ Key Features

-   **Single-Page Application (SPA)**: A fast and fluid user experience with no full-page reloads.
